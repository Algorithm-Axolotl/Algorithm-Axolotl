- 👋 Hi, I’m @Algorithm-Axolotl
- 👀 I’m interested in solo game development!
- Check me out on: 

Itch.io: https://algorithm-axolotl.itch.io/

My main website of choice. I post updates, announcements and everything on here. It's also my most complete list of projects!

Gd.games: https://gd.games/Algorithm_Axolotl

Gd.games is a place to play games made with gdevelop (an open-source, no-code game engine) right on the website. Since gdevelop is my preferred game engine I post some of my games there. However some of my games can't be posted there due to technical reasons. Learn more about why some games aren't available here

GitHub: https://github.com/Algorithm-Axolotl

Because its nice to have a GitHub you know. I'll change my status to reflect recent announcements!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning computer science! 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 📫 How to reach me: that's the neat part, you dont!
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: If it weren't for the gdevelop big game jam 5, I might not have been a game dev!
